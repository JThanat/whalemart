# 20. Human Factors 

**20.1. Type of Users**

There are two types of member: Lessor and Vendor. Scope of each type of users is describe in Section 2.

**20.2. Level of Ability of Users**

The system is developed as a web application so users need some basic abilities to use our system as describe in Table 20‑1.

**20.3. Training users to use the system**

To bring about the ability to use our system smoothly, our team planned to provide the necessary knowledge to each type of the users. We’ll provide two kind of training sessions for vendors and lessors.
    
    20.3.1. Vendor training session:

Train vendors who want to lend the booth in a market in the system. The condition that this training session will be held is when users tend not to have enough ability to use our system in some markets that use our system. This session will be held in a meeting room with the capacity equal to the estimated amount of people who interested in that market. The details of this session are shown in Table 20‑2.

    20.3.3. Lessor training session:

Train lessors who interested in our system but don’t have the ability to use it. This training session will be held once in a while to provide knowledge to new lessors who interested in our system. Since the number of lessors won’t be high so this will be a small group or even person-to-person training. The details of this training session are shown in Table 20‑3.
