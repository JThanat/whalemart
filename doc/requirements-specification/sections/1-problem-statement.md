# 1. Problem Statement
**1.1. Background and Significance of the Problem**

Flea market has become a popular attraction in Thailand for both local people and travelers. Flea market has more than 14% market share over all the market in Thailand. This means there are more than 50,000 vendors currently in the market. Therefore, the booth management system is important for managing this number of vendors.
Online flea market booth rental and reservation system, used by lessors to provide available booths for vendors, should be simple and effective system. The vendors should be able to know available booth and booth layout in real-time and make the reservation of the booth that they need as fast as possible. The system should also help vendors to simplify their reservation, payment, and confirmation process. On the other hand, this system should reduce lessors' reservation management process and let the lessors consider vendors profile and arrange the booths easily. In addition, it should support payment verification for lessors to confirm renters’ payment.
