# 21. Acceptance Criteria

1. **System Testing**

    1.1.	Unit Tests<br>
    During the development phase, the development team must prepare for testing system and make sure that the tests are correct and comprehensive in detailed system design. If any mistake happened in the system, the test can detect the failure of system before deploying and fix it beforehand. Moreover, it can prevent regression from happening. It also makes sure that the code structure is well-designed.<br>
    The unit tests are divided into separate class which contains input and expected output, and each test case is trying to pass input into a class or method that would like to test, if output from method is matching to expected output then the test will be passed and will be rejected on the otherwise. We must design test-cases comprehensively to verify that the test cases can test all possible real use-cases in system.

    1.2.	Integration Tests<br>
    We must test correctness of each module/class which works with another module/class. The objective of integration tests is to test how multiple components in our system is stitched together instead of testing each component in isolation; it behaves as the whole picture of how multiple functions perform. Therefore, integration tests focus on testing connection between interface. It also prevents the broken code from being merged into the repository.<br>
    Each interface will receive tested input and behave corresponding to the input. We must design test-cases comprehensively to verify that our integration tests can test all possible use-cases in system and behave normally as we expected.

    1.3.	System Tests<br>
    When we have developed system until the system met requirement as we desired. We must confident that our system met all agreement documentation in chapter 4 before deliver to customer. So, we must verify our system again. If we found failures, we can fix it beforehand. The objective of system tests is focus on function requirements and qualitative requirements in this document to test the completeness of system by manually tested by developer instead of automation.

    1.4.	Acceptance Tests<br>
    When we finished developing the system, before deliver the system to client. We must do testing together between client, user and developer to make sure that our system pass completely through all acceptance tests. If the system canâ€™t pass the criteria. Developer must fix all mistakes in system and test it again.

2. **Acceptance Criteria**<br>
The objective of acceptance criteria is to consider that system can perform completely in agreement between client, user and developer, also consider and verify all deliverables system, and sent to client after finish testing. Acceptance criteria divide to 3 group as follows:

    2.1 Acceptance criteria for functional requirements<br>
    For acceptance criteria in first group. It is acceptance criteria for functional requirements. It must test all users in different role in each user. How each user interacts to system and scope of functionality that user can do. List of acceptance criteria for functional requirements are shown as follows
