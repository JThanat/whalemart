The due date, purpose, and breakdowns of each document are explained in detail as follows: 

**19.1. Problem Statement Document**<br>
**Due date:** August 24, 2017 (Already delivered)<br>
Problem statement was prepared by a system analyst by coordinating with customers to indicate a scope of the system, categorize users based on their role, and determine limitation of our system. The problem statement document consists of following subjects:
