# 19. Documentation
In this part, we will introduce and describe all documentations associated with the project and our system. There are four documents involved which consist of problem statement, software requirements specification, design document, test plan and user manual. The due date, purpose, and breakdowns of each document are explained in detail as follows: 

**19.1. Problem Statement Document**<br>
**Due date:** August 24, 2017 (Already delivered)<br>
Problem statement was prepared by a system analyst by coordinating with customers to indicate a scope of the system, categorize users based on their role, and determine limitation of our system. The problem statement document consists of following subjects:
  1. Definition of Terms<br>
  2. Background and Significance of the Problem<br>
  3. Objective<br>
  4. System Overview<br>
  5. System Scope<br>
  6. Input and Output of the System<br>
  7. User and their Connection to the System<br>
  8. Constraints<br>

**19.2. Software Requirements Specification Document**<br>
**Due date:** September 19, 2017 (This documentation)<br>
Software requirements specification document is de facto this current one being read, which describes in detail about how we divide project into smaller pieces, analyzes overall use cases of the system, and provides the information on how functionality of each use case works. The software requirements specification document consists of the subjects as follows:
  1. Introduction
  2. Functional Requirements
  3. Qualitative Requirements
  4. Documentation
  5. Constraints
  6. Benefits
  7. Human Factors
  8. Acceptance Criteria

**19.3. Design Document**<br>
**Due date:** October 31, 2017<br>
Design document is a document which being developed from the pre-defined system requirements in an analyze phase. This document describes how system works and provides brief explanation of the system. All information in this design document will be used for further development as well as deployment. The design document consists of the following subjects:
  1. Sample Screen of User Interfaces
  2. System Architecture
    - Component Diagram
    - Deployment Diagram
    - Class Diagram (Attributes, Operations, Visibility)
  3. Pseudocode for Major Methods (Operations)
  4. Access Control Table


**19.4. Test Plan and User Manual**<br>
**Due date:** November 28, 2017<br>
Test plan is a document which describes a test plan to ensure that the system can perform correctly and meet pre-defined requirements specification. Objective of this test plan document is to improve the system behavior to be close to the flawless one that we expected. For user manual, it provides system users how to use the system. The test plan along with user manual consists of the following subjects:
  1. Test Plan
  2. Test Results
  3. User Manual
  4. Appendix
    - Limitations
    - Deviations from the Design Document
    - Soft Copy of All Documents
