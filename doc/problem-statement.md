1. Time limitations
    
    This project will be planned and developed in 3 months (by the end of November).

2. Budget limitations

    Since this system is developed from the ground up, new hardware needs to be purchased to support the developing process and to operate the system. The estimation of the expense is shown below.
    * MacBook Air 13‚Äù 2015 (x4) 300,000 Baht
    * Cloud server (CPU x8 cores 3.30 GHz and Memory 64 GB) 125,000 Baht
    * Project development (Cost per person x 8) 360,000 Baht
    Total cost in development (estimate fully-development in 4 months) 785,000 Baht

3. Hardware

    * The server must provide support all the time
    * The application must be available with higher than 99.9% available rate
    * The average latency response time must be lower than 250ms
    * The server must be capable of scaling during peak time

4. Software
    * The minimum version of browser that application is fully support is Internet Explorer 9 or above and all modern browsers
    * The application is support with both mobile platform and screen platform
    * The application must be capable of rearranging the designed elements to fit in any screens
    
5. Personnel

    Our team consists of 8 people. Most of our team members have experience in developing and deploying web applications. So, planning and developing this project would be done with very few issues.
